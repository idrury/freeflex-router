## 3. Data Storage and Security

Your personal information is stored on servers located in Australia, managed by our backend platform provider, Supabase. Supabase implements stringent security measures and data access controls to protect your information from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure. These measures include encryption in transit and at rest.

Within our organisation, team members are trained in data protection laws and are granted access to personal information only on a need-to-know basis to perform their specific duties.

While we take reasonable steps to secure your personal information, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.

## 4. Disclosure of Personal Information

We may disclose your personal information to the following third parties:

* **Stripe:** To process payments related to any paid features we may introduce in the future.
* **Google and Apple:** To facilitate calendar integration and user authorization, as described in Section 1.
* **Supabase:** As our backend platform provider, Supabase stores and processes all your data necessary for the functioning of FreeFlex. While their servers are located overseas, they have robust data protection policies in place.
* **Meticulous AI:** To analyse user activity for automated testing and platform improvement. Meticulous is based in the US, and your user activity data will be transferred to the United States. We rely on their SOC2 Type II compliance and aim to only share data necessary for testing purposes.
* **Legal Authorities:** If required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request.
* **In the event of a business sale or merger:** Your personal information may be transferred to the new owners so that they can continue to provide the services.
* **With your explicit consent:** In situations not otherwise covered by this policy.

Some of these third parties, including Google, Supabase, and Stripe, are located in the United States. When we disclose your personal information to overseas recipients, we take reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient complies with the Australian Privacy Principles or a substantially similar law. However, you acknowledge that we cannot guarantee the data handling practices of these third parties.
