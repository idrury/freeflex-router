**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

Welcome to FreeFlex (www.freeflex.com.au), an online platform designed to help Australian freelancers streamline their business management. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the FreeFlex service, including our website, mobile applications, and any related services (collectively, the "Service").

# 1. Service Description

FreeFlex is a software tool designed specifically for Australian freelancers to streamline their administrative tasks. The Service provides features for managing clients, projects (including prioritisation, status tracking, and note-taking), generating invoices and quotes (pre-filled with project and client details, with the ability to convert between them), creating contracts (also pre-filled with relevant details and attachable to invoices/quotes), and providing a budget overview based on entered invoices and expenses, including basic financial reporting. The intended purpose is to eliminate the need for spreadsheets and constant data migration, saving freelancers time and allowing them to focus on their core work.

The Service is solely a software tool. FreeFlex does not offer any advisory, legal, or accounting services. Users are responsible for ensuring their use of the Service complies with all applicable Australian laws. The Service is intended for use by individuals geographically based in Australia.
