## About contracts
Contracts are an important part of projects, and it's a good idea to ask a client to sign a contract before you commence working with them. 

Many businesses choose to send contracts along with a quote (which you can do with FreeFlex), but you can also download a contract and send it as a stand-alone.

## Getting started
FreeFlex contracts must be copied in as text into the editing panel.

You can copy in an existing contract from microsoft word (or similar), or start from scratch! 

*We hope to have some custom contract templates coming soon*

Use the style bar up the top to customise the style of contracts, and add different types of headings. You can also add lists and use the *Tx* button to remove styling.

***WARNING: Make sure to preview your contract before sending it, as issues can sometimes occur when the contract is converted from doc to pdf form.***

## Previewing and using contracts
To view and download a contract from the contract editing panel, press the '...' menu and select 'Preview'. This will bring up the contract viewer.

***WARNING: Please note that your contract may change slightly when it is converted to a pdf!***

Press the download button in the PDF previewer to download the contract.

Alternatively, you can attach a contract to a quote by selecting it from within the quote or invoice editing page.
